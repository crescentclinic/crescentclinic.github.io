      <h3>Consultation Policy</h3>
       <p>
                <b>Token:-</b> A valid token is mandatory for each consultation. Consultation will be based on token
                order. Bystanders should take token separately for consultation. Both new patients and those with
                previous prescriptions must obtain a token. No token is required for the first follow-up visit if it
                occurs within one week of the previous consultation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Emergency &amp; Accident Cases:-</b> We provides outpatient services only. We do not offer inpatient
                care, emergency care and trauma care. For emergency or trauma care, please visit a properly equipped
                Emergency Department or casualty. We accepts no liability for adverse outcomes caused by delays in
                seeking emergency care. Consultations here are conducted on a token basis, not by emergency triage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Consultation Guidelines:-</b> Only one bystander is allowed per patient in the consultation room or
                observation area. Bystander presence is mandatory for children and female patients. Bystander presence
                is required during suturing, surgical procedures, or drug administration. Bystander must be at least 18
                years old and of sound mind. Consultation and procedure charges are fixed and non-negotiable. If
                unacceptable, please leave without dispute. The doctor manages both outpatients and walk-in emergency
                cases; delays may occur. If this is unacceptable, please seek care at another clinic or hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home Services, Telecommunication and booking:-</b> No home services are provided. In case of an
                emergency outside clinic hours, visit the nearest hospital with an Emergency Department. Digital
                communication (SMS, email, WhatsApp) is provided for administrative convenience only. It is not a
                substitute for in-person medical consultation. We are not responsible for any consequences arising from
                delayed, missed, or misunderstood digital communication. Medical advice will not be provided via phone,

                video or audio recording without prior permission is prohibited. Wearing a mask is mandatory inside

                infection. The clinic is not a place for displaying influence (muscle power, wealth, political
